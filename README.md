FluxBB configuration used for Textpattern support forum
======

Install
------

Work in progress, but the plan would be to allow use of Composer:

    $ composer create-project https://github.com/textpattern/fluxbb.git /

After which you would follow the standard [FluxBB installation steps](http://fluxbb.org/docs/v1.5/installing).

Development
------

Development happens in the __feature-textpattern-forum__ branch:

    $ git clone --branch feature-textpattern-forum git@github.com:textpattern/fluxbb.git
